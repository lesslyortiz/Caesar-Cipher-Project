How much did you remember right away from your previous experience?:
I luckily remembered a decent amount of what I needed for this homework and only had to refresh a bit on the syntax for indexing and list related code.   

How much came back after working with the program for a little while?:
Most of the basics. Since I took csc111 just last semester everything started to come back as I wrote the code.

Did you learn anything new that you hadn't known before?:
Before the homework I was still pretty unused to code using files and importing/reading/exporting material to and from them so that was re-learning process. I did learn a completely new bit of how to export output to a seperate file. 

What was the most challenging part?: Figuring out how to order and create the shiftLetter function and debugging it to fix the alphabet wrap-arounds.
